[CoE 202] Basics of Artificial Intelligence&lt;Physical AI> Team 2 정우현, 오나영, 진유경
This is the final project from CoE 202 class in KAIST.
We used 'Modi' and 'raspbeerypi' together.
Also, for the camera connection, we used 'DroidCam'.
For hardware, some parts are printed by FDM 3D printers but most of parts are lego blocks.
We will soon upload some descriptions about hardware and the way to modify the code.
Thanks.
